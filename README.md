# OFF THE HOOK

This is the splash screen: <img src="https://github.com/elzbyfar/off-the-hook-client-side-update/blob/master/App/assets/img/title-screen.gif" width="20%"/>

This is an iOS side-scrolling 2D aquatic-themed mobile game with single-handed gameplay. I used React Native, React Native Game Engine, Matter-JS and Ruby On Rails with PostgreSQL on the backend. Inspired by FlappyBird with an underwater twist.
