<h3>Description & Game Premise</h3>

  This is an iOS compatible side-scrolling, 2D, aquatic-themed, multi-level game
  that allows single-handed gameplay. The object of the game is for a user to
  move their character across dangerous waters collecting Pellets in a given
  amount of time while avoiding other creatures and hooks. This game was inspired by FlappyBird but has an underwater twist.
